# Deploying Qlicker

## Manual deployment as a node app

Currently, the only tested deployments of Qlicker are manual deployments following this method ([https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-meteor-js-application-on-ubuntu-14-04-with-nginx](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-meteor-js-application-on-ubuntu-14-04-with-nginx))

Using the `meteor build` command, a standalone node app is bundled and can be deployed on any machine with node and mongodb. In production environments this may be the best option.

## Docker?
