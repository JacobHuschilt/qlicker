## Starting Up
To obtain an account with professor privileges, another professor or administrator must created your account. Contact a fellow professor or your system administrator.

An professor account can create courses and run sessions within their course.

## Creating Courses
There are two ways to create a course; first is by going to the Qlicker Home page and clicking 'Create Course', and second is by selecting 'Courses' in the navigation bar, then 'All Courses', and clicking 'Create Course'.

Enter the following information in the prompt:
+ **Name:** The name of the course
+ **Department Code:** The course's department code
+ **Course Number:** The number of the course
+ **Section:** The course's section
+ **Semester:** The current semester

The course should show up on both the Qlicker Home page, and the Courses page.  


### Enrolling Students in Your Courses
To allow students to enrol in one of your courses, you need to provide a 6-digit enrolment code. This can be found under "Course Details" on the course's main page. To get to the course main page, select the desired course in either the Qlicker Home page, the Courses page, or the 'Courses' dropdown menu.

Once there are students enrolled, the "Classlist" section will populate, where you can remove students from the classlist. 


## Creating Questions
Questions can either be created within a [session](#creating-sessions) or by going to the Questions page via 'My Question Library' in the 'Questions' dropdown menu. Click 'New Question' to create a question.
