## Starting Up

## Creating Courses
There are two ways to create a course; first is by going to the Qlicker Home page and clicking 'Create Course', and second is by selecting 'Courses' in the navigation bar, then 'All Courses', and clicking 'Create Course'.

The course should show up on both the Qlicker Home page, and the Courses page.  


### Enrolling Students in Your Courses
To allow students to enrol in one of your courses, you need to provide a 6-digit enrolment code. This can be found under "Course Details" on the course's main page. To get to the course main page, select the desired course in either the Qlicker Home page, the Courses page, or the 'Courses' dropdown menu.

Once there are students enrolled, the "Classlist" section will populate, where you can remove students from the classlist. 


## Creating Questions
Questions can either be created within a [session](#creating-sessions) or by going to the Questions Library via 'My Question Library' in the 'Questions' dropdown menu. Click 'New Question' to create a question.

The question edit form will show up, and you can enter or toggle the following:
+ **Duplicate:** This button creates a copy of the question
+ **Delete:** This deletes the currently selected question
+ **Make Public/Private:** Public questions can be viewed by any Professor for any course. Private is tied to only to your account. 
+ **Question Tags:** Tags can be added to the question to make searching and selecting questions easier. 
+ **Question?** This is where the question text is entered. The text can be  modified using the toolbar above the form. 
+ **Answers:** There are four different questions types. See below for more details. 

Each edit created will automatically save the question.

#### Question Types 
There are four question types to choose from; multiple choice, multi-select, true or false, and short answer. For multiple choice and multi-select, there can be a max of 6 answers to choose from. Like question text, the answers can be modified using the toollbar. Correct and Incorrect options can be toggled by clicking on "correct" or "incorrect".

### Using the Question Library
The Question Library can be found via the 'Questions' dropdown menu. This page contains all questions saved to the library, for all courses you own. On this page, you can create new questions, search for questions using keywords, type, or tags, and access Public and Student-submitted questions.

### Public Questions
Public questions can be accessed by clicking 'Public Questions' at the top of the Question Library page. Public questions are all questions submitted by other users that were marked as public. These questions can be searched using keywords, question type, and tags.

To copy a public question to your library, select the desired question from the list and click 'Copy to Library' above the question preview. The copied question can now be modified, and used in your sessions.

### Student Submissions
Student-submitted questions can be accessed by clicking 'Student Submissions' at the top of the Question Library page. Student-submitted questions are automatically tagged with the department code and course number of the course they submitted the question to. These questions can be searched using keywords, question type, and tags.

To copy a student-submitted question to your library, select the desired question from the list and click 'Copy to Library' above the question preview. The copied question can now be modified, and used in your sessions.

## Creating Sessions
Course sessions are the means of getting the questions out to your students. To create a session, go to the course's main page and click 'Create Course'. To get to the course main page, select the desired course in either the Qlicker Home page, the Courses page, or the 'Courses' dropdown menu.

Enter the following information in the prompt:
+ **Name:** The name of the session. We would recommend naming it by the date you're expecting to run this session.
+ **Description:** A description of the session.

The created session will show up under the "Sessions" section as a draft.

### Editing Sessions
To edit a session, select the session under the "Sessions" section of the course main page. This will bring you to the Edit Session page. 

The intial view shows the current questions assigned to the session and various options for the session. These options include running the session, assigning a date to the session, changing the name or description of the session, adding tags to the session, and labelling the session as either a Draft - where student's cannot see it, Upcoming - where student's can see it, but not interact with it, Live, or Inactive. Questions existing in the session can be removed, duplicated, and dragged to change the order. You can also add new questions directly to the session from this view. 

Selecting 'Question Library' brings up a list of all questions in your library. You can also select Public Questions, or Student Submissions from the first dropdown selection. Questions can be searched by keyword, type, or tag. To add an existing question to the session, click on the desired question in the list and it will be copied into the session.

### Copying Session
Once sessions are populated in the "Sessions" section, you can delete the session, duplicate it to the current course, and copy it to another course you own. 

## Running Sessions
Running a session means that students are able to interact with and contribute responses to the session. To run the session, go to the Edit Session page and click 'Run Session'.

The current view shows an aggregation of response results and stats, and a question preview of the current session on the right, with a toolbar and an indication of how many students are active in the session, and how many students responded to the current question on the left. The results will auto-update once students submit responses. 

In the toolbar, you can toggle the following:
